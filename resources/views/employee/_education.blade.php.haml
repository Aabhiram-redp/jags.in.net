          It is a good institute to lean Computer languages. There were well educated, highly
          qualified teachers along with bad teachers. Good is more than Bad, so no issues. I learned
          Java, Core Java, EJB, Oracle database. I met lots of good and highly educated friends.
          I had participated in live Java Project.
