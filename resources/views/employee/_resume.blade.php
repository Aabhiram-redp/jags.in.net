        Working as a Frontend Developer, I use HTML,CSS and jQuery to build responsive websites. In this modern
        world people want more, I can do Angular, React, Backbone applications. Other than a
        frontend developer i can build Rails applications, Rails is almost similar to famous
        PHP Framework Laravel.

        knowledge in Wordpress and Drupal is almost similar. Self learning was very important,
        They won't provide too much training.  I liked their 8.30AM - 6PM
        Working our, Company close after that so i had lots of time in Home.

        It was an internship, but company told that it was job during interview,'They cheat us'!! LOL. Armia is a big company lots of employees. There were lots of people. I perform badly
        so they didn't chose me. I heard lots of new technologies like nodejs, mango db etc.
        I had basic knowledge in PHP, so there was nothing so special, i was very week in MySQL, basially
        i'm not an Computer Science student. I didn't have computer science related subjects in
        my classes except in Engineering. They didn't choose me, i also wanted same. I hate Infopark
        No Buses, Bad road also i can't leave office at 6.30, my last bus leave Kakkanad at 6.50 PM and no buses after that.
        I was very happy when they said "You have no Jobs here"...
